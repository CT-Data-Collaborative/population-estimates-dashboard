### About the data

This dataset includes population estimates of Connecticut’s total population at the state, planning region, and town levels from the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates
Program (PEP) and the official population estimates for the state of Connecticut certified by Connecticut’s Department of Public Health (DPH).


In addition, this dataset includes estimates of the components of population change (births, deaths, and domestic and international migration) at the state and planning region
levels from the PEP, and new housing units permitted annually in each town from the Census Bureau’s Building Permit Survey.

This data powers the [Connecticut Population Estimates Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/connecticut.state.data.center/viz/ConnecticutPopulationEstimatesJuly2024/PEPDashboard).
